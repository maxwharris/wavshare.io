I want to make a website where users can post self-made samples OR links to songs on Youtube, and other users can download and reply with their own remix.

The end product should be a combination of Soundcloud and WhoSampled. 

To add: 

- Require email verification before allowing users to post/reply.

- Change fonts / design

Existing Issues:
- Fast forward and rewind button functionality
